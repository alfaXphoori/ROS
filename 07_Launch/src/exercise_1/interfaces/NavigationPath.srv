# NavigationPath.srv
# Service for calculating safe navigation paths around obstacles
# Real-world use: Autonomous warehouse robot obstacle avoidance

# Request - Detected obstacle dimensions and current robot position
float64 obstacle_length      # Obstacle length in meters
float64 obstacle_width       # Obstacle width in meters
float64 robot_x              # Robot current X position (meters)
float64 robot_y              # Robot current Y position (meters)
float64 safety_margin        # Required safety clearance (meters)
string zone_id               # Warehouse zone identifier (e.g., "DOCK-3-BAY-12")

# Response - Calculated navigation path
float64 safe_area            # Total safe navigation area (m²)
float64 path_perimeter       # Boundary perimeter length (m)
float64 clearance_left       # Left side clearance (m)
float64 clearance_right      # Right side clearance (m)
bool can_navigate            # True if path is safe for navigation
string recommended_action    # "PROCEED", "REDUCE_SPEED", "REROUTE", or "STOP"
float64 estimated_time       # Estimated time to navigate (seconds)
